# General How To

How To: Desolder: [http://www.bestsoldering.com/learn-how-to-desolder-beginners-guide/](http://www.bestsoldering.com/learn-how-to-desolder-beginners-guide/) 
* heat and pull vs heat and push with bull-nose plier then pull/leverage 
  as heat 
* heat and push lead gently with bull-nose plier, then can pull 
  more easily
* copper mesh works more consistently than solder sucker to remove solder around stubborn parts

How To: Solder: [http://www.bestsoldering.com/learn-how-to-solder-beginners-guide/](http://www.bestsoldering.com/learn-how-to-solder-beginners-guide/) 
* use cut offs leads to help clear stubborn holes. Hold with pliers 
  using very short lead to push 
* release solder then run tip of soldering iron up lead as release 
  to draw heat away a little slower 
* use alligator clips to hold other lead in place to pull part 
  tight against board 
* put small amount of flux on the lead using a toothpick or small 
  brush

use epoxy, RTX, etc but must dry first completely
